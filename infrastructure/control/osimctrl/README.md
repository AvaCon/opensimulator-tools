A simple couple of scripts for starting components of OpenSimulator as a user rather
than root.  Incorporates checks to avoid starting a component instance if one
is already running

Starts named screen instances for the components.  To shutdown the simulator
you need to connect to the appropriate screen instance and do this manually.
