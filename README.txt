A bunch of miscellaneous tools that may (or may not) grow over time.

create-user-line-generator    - a very basic script to generate a bunch of create user lines for pasting into the OpenSimulator Robust
console in order to generate many users simultaneously (e.g. for bot testing purposes
opensimulator-script-analyzer - a very basic script that looks for OpenSimulator script functions (ll, os, mod, etc)
in a bunch of files and prints out the number of times each one is used.
