README

This is a very small repository to contain a python script to analyze one or more LSL
files (as extracted from an OAR, for instance) and list which LSL/OSSL, etc. functions
are being used.

Probably the biggest immediate addition is to say which files these are actually found
in if one needs to delve deeper.
