A bunch of miscellaneous tools that may (or may not) grow over time.

create-user-line-generator    - a very basic script to generate a bunch of create user lines for pasting into an OpenSimulator ROBUST
console in order to generate many users simultaneously (e.g. for bot testing purposes

opensimulator-script-analyzer - a very basic script that looks for OpenSimulator script functions (ll, os, mod, etc)
in a bunch of files and prints out the number of times each one is used.

reset-user-password-line-generator - another very basic script to generate a bunch of reset user password lines for pasting
into an OpenSimulator ROBUST console.  One use is to reset bot scripts.
